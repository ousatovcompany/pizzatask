AndroidDevelopment Assignment
Please submit this assignment as a public git repository and provide me a link to it.
Please also send me a link to an apk file hosted on some cloud storage. Your assignment
is to write an executable app which uses Foursquare APIs https://foursquare.com/
Please display pizza restaurants close to the user position (+ add a possibility 
to emulate user's location in the center of New York). The resulting list should 
at least show the restaurant name and distance to the user. The list should be sorted 
in an ascending order using distance. Lazy loading should be implemented. App should 
fetch and show only first 10 restaurants. The bottommost list item should contain
a loading indicator. When loading indicator becomes visible app should request 10 more 
restaurant from the API. You are free to use any method you want in order to achieve this,
i.e. treat the assignment as you would any other project. Create another screen with 
details of a single PizzaPlace. Please make a transition to the newly created screen 
when user clicks on some list item. Display there some detailed information passed from
the previous screen. Downloaded data must be persisted. App must display latest 
downloaded data if there is no Internet connection. All disk writes must be performed 
asynchronously. You are free to choose any libraries or tools. Explain your choice.
